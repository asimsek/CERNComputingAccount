> How to request a computing account for a new student.

1. Go to `https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/secr/reg/regCMS.jsp` and fill the form.

- **Email:** any email you're mostly using: hotmail, gmail etc. you'll contact with the CMS secretariat from this email address. 
- **Name:** Your family name (surname)
- **First Name:** your name
- **Institute:** Cukurova University
- **Institute Representative:** (should be Ä°sa Dumanoglu but i'm not sure)
- **Activity:** (Should be **User** or **CMS**, not sure)


2. Click on `Ask CMS secretariat` button.

> After the form, you'll receive an email with your **HRPersonID** as:

    Dear XX YY (ADANA-CUKUROVA),
    You are now registered in CMS as 'Non-Doctoral Student' from your institute (ADANA-CUKUROVA) .

You will use the **HRPersonID** number in the next mail.
When you receive the mail above, send an email to `cms.people@cern.ch` as below.


***Mail Subject : CERN Account***
> Dear Sir / Madame,
>
>	I'm now registered in CMS as 'Non-Doctoral Student' from my institute (ADANA-CUKUROVA). Could you provide my "Username" and "Initial Password", please.
>
>	Thank You.

> Surname, Name
> 
> HRpersonId:

***For Step-1:***
They will ask you to upload a copy of your ID (english) or passport to the system.

***For Step-2:***
Also they'll ask you to fill another form that your team leader (Isa Dumanoglu for CU) will approve your account.


After these steps, they should send you your username. Probably they'll **not** send your initial password. You'll get an email as:

> Welcome to CERN. Your Primary Account was automatically created.
> 
> Name: XXX YYY
> 
> Login: xxxxx
> 
> Email: your initial email address (hotmail, gmail etc.)

## If they won't send you an initial password:
For the initial password, you should send another email to `service-desk@cern.ch` as:

***Mail Subject: CMS Account Activation & Initial Password***

> Dear CERN People,
>
> My account "xxxxx" is now added to the CMS (zh) group, however it's currently disabled. Could you activate my account and send my initial password, please?
>
> Thank you.
>
> Best regards,
>
> Surname, Name
>
> HRpersonId :



They'll activate your account and send you an email including your initial password. Please follow the required actions section in your mail and change your account and EDH passwords in 3 days.


ps. these steps can be changed partly but more or less the process is the same.
